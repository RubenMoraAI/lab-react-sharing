## little explanation of code
This code is a simple Next.js 13 application, and this repository is a lab to show some sharing data between components problems and solutions. 

This code uses all the code in the src folder, now, Next.js 13 uses the app directory, and all page.tsx has its own component directory with all components used; in this case, the project has only one page. 
The directory for components, has three directories: 
- Atomic directory with atomic components.
- Layout directory with the Navbar component.
- Samples directory with the principal samples components.
 
The sharing data components have a fake representation of components like BLockchain and to sources Wallet with itself account and Exchange with the respective account, only for didactic purposes, and easy segregate concepts and functionality. Please navigate between the components to see the different solutions and see the code in the components.
